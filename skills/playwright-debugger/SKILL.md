# Playwright Failed Test Debugger

Diagnose Playwright test failures from report files. Classifies root causes and provides concrete fixes.

## Prerequisites: Get the Report

Determine the report source in this order:

**1. `playwright-report/` already exists locally** → skip to Phase 1.

**2. No report available** → run tests locally and write output to a file (do NOT read stdout directly — output may be truncated):

```bash
npx playwright test --reporter=json 2>/dev/null > playwright-report/results.json
```

**3. Report exists but is from CI and you need to reproduce locally for Phase 3 trace inspection** → download the CI artifact (`gh run download <run-id> -n playwright-report` or via CI UI) into `playwright-report/`, then reproduce the specific failing test locally with the same environment:

```bash
# Match CI's chromium project + retries; capture trace + video for failed runs
npx playwright test path/to/spec.spec.ts --project=chromium --retries=2 \
  --trace=retain-on-failure --video=retain-on-failure

# If CI uses a non-default baseURL or env, mirror it
PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=<ci-base-url> npx playwright test path/to/spec.spec.ts
```

If the test passes locally but failed in CI → likely **F7 (test isolation)** or **F8 (environment mismatch)**; jump to Phase 2 with that hypothesis instead of trying to repro further.

## Phase 1: Extract Failures

Locate `results.json` under `playwright-report/`, then extract all tests where `status` is `"failed"` or `"timedOut"`. For each failed test, collect: `title`, `status`, `error.message`, `location.file`, `duration`.

Use `jq` if available:

```bash
cat playwright-report/results.json | jq '[
  .. | objects |
  select(.status == "failed" or .status == "timedOut") |
  {title: .title, status: .status, error: .error.message, file: .location.file, duration: .duration}
] | unique'
```

If `jq` is unavailable, read the JSON file directly with the Read tool and extract failed tests manually.

## Phase 2: Classify Root Cause

Use Phase 1 output (error message + duration + file) to classify each failure. **Most failures are identifiable here — only go to Phase 3 if still unclear.**

| # | Category | Signals | Review Pattern |
|---|----------|---------|----------------|
| F1 | **Flaky / Timing** | `TimeoutError`, duration near maxTimeout, passes on retry | #9 |
| F2 | **Selector Broken** | `locator not found`, `strict mode violation`, element count mismatch | #6, #10 |
| F3 | **Network Dependency** | `net::ERR_*`, unexpected API response, `404`/`500` | — |
| F4 | **Assertion Mismatch** | `Expected X to equal Y`, over-broad check | #4 |
| F5 | **Missing Then** | Action completed but wrong state remains | #2 |
| F6 | **Condition Branch Missing** | Element conditionally present, assertion always runs | #5 |
| F7 | **Test Isolation Failure** | Passes alone, fails in suite; leaked state | — |
| F8 | **Environment Mismatch** | CI vs local only; viewport, OS, timezone | — |
| F9 | **Data Dependency** | Missing seed data, hardcoded IDs | — |
| F10 | **Auth / Session** | Session expired, role-based UI not rendered | — |
| F11 | **Async Order Assumption** | `Promise.all` order, parallel race | — |
| F12 | **POM / Locator Drift** | DOM changed, POM locator not updated | #10 |
| F13 | **Error Swallowing** | `.catch(() => {})` hiding failure, test passes silently | #3 |
| F14 | **Animation Race** | Element visible but content not yet rendered | #9 |

Classification steps:
1. Match error message to signals above
2. `duration` near timeout → F1 or F3
3. CI-only failure → F7 or F8
4. Passes on retry → F1

## Phase 3: Trace Analysis (only if Phase 2 is unclear)

`trace.zip` contains three parts:
- `trace.trace` — newline-delimited JSON events (actions, snapshots, console logs)
- `trace.network` — newline-delimited JSON (network requests and responses)
- `resources/` — JPEG screenshots per step

Find trace files: `find playwright-report -name "*.zip" | head -10`

Extract and read each file using `unzip -p <trace.zip> <entry>`, then parse the newline-delimited JSON. Stop as soon as the root cause is clear.

**What to look for at each step:**

1. **Which step failed** — filter `trace.trace` events where `type === "after"` and `error` is present. Log `apiName` and `error.message`.

2. **All actions with pass/fail** — filter `trace.trace` for `type === "after"`, log index, `apiName`, and whether `error` is set.

3. **DOM at the failed step** (selector issues) — filter `trace.trace` for `type === "frame-snapshot"` matching the `beforeSnapshot` name from step 2. Inspect `snapshot.html`.

4. **Failed network requests** — filter `trace.network` for `type === "resource-snapshot"` where `response.status >= 400`. Log status and URL.

5. **JS console errors** — filter `trace.trace` for `type === "console"` and `messageType === "error"`. Log `text`.

6. **Still unclear** — add temporary `page.screenshot()` calls before and after the failing action, re-run, then inspect the screenshots with a browser agent. Remove screenshots after debugging.

## Phase 4: Fix Suggestions

For each failure, produce a finding in this format:

**`[P0/P1/P2] test name — Category`**
- **Category:** e.g. F2 — Selector Broken (#10 POM Drift)
- **Error:** the raw error message
- **Root Cause:** one sentence explanation
- **Fix:** before/after code showing the concrete change

**Severity:**
- **P0:** Test passes silently when feature is broken (F6, F13)
- **P1:** Intermittent or misleading failures (F1, F2, F3, F7, F11, F14)
- **P2:** Consistent failures, straightforward fix (F4, F5, F8, F9, F10, F12)

## Output Format

```
Failure Summary
- Total: N failed (M flaky, K broken, J environment)

[P0] `test name` — F13 Error Swallowing
...

Review Summary
| Sev | Count | Top Category     | Files            |
|-----|-------|------------------|------------------|
| P0  | 1     | Error Swallowing | auth.spec.ts     |
| P1  | 3     | Flaky / Timing   | dashboard.spec.ts|
| P2  | 2     | POM Drift        | settings.spec.ts |

Fix P0 first. Run npx playwright test --retries=2 to confirm flaky tests.
